# Machine Learning app 
Hi there ! 👋

I did my first machine learning project, it was focus on understanding different models as Logistic Regression, KNN or Decision tree and choosing the best one. ❓

Then, I just follow some Flask tutoriels to implement my model on a web app. 😎

I put just there some screeshot of this result !
